# leetCodeQuestions
Welcome to my history of learning and suffering. I've been doing (almost)everyday algorithm question challenge. It's important to know data structures/algorithms(so-called "fundamentals")  to be a "good" developer, so I figured it'd be beneficial to make such a habit. 
There's still a long way to go until I can comfortably solve problems. Until that day, my challenge goes on and on.
